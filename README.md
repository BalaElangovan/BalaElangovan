As a Healthcare Analytics Developer, I build and deliver analytics solutions that support healthcare operations. My work involves developing dashboards in Power BI, creating custom Power Apps, automating workflows with Power Automate, and utilizing SQL and DAX for data manipulation. I also manage data warehousing and testing processes, applying DevOps principles for robust solutions.

Outside of my core role, I actively develop Python-based projects, with a keen interest in automating tasks, exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP), and building Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Network models.
