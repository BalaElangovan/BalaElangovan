Hi, I'm Bala. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Data Science and Analytics. I don't have any impressive work to showcase, but I'm actively learning and building my portfolio from scratch. So, This readme file is gonna updated soon with some cool projects :) 

I code on Python and I'm pretty fluent with basic libraries like Numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc. I do read a lot of blogs and I do write blogs on my own. 

I'm really good at automating in bash and I was a former Web-App Pentester (bug bounty hunter) with 15+ acknowledgements and hall-of-fame from several companies which includes Blackberry, Coursera, canva and much more.
